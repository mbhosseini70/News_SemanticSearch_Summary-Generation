High-Level Overview of Semantic Search and Summarization Pipeline\n\nThis document provides an abstract overview of the key steps and functionalities implemented in the provided Python code, which combines semantic search and summarization to process and analyze news articles.\n\n## 1. **Dataset Loading and Preprocessing**\n   - The pipeline utilizes the **CNN/DailyMail dataset** to work with news articles.\n   - The dataset is filtered to include a manageable subset of articles (e.g., 50 rows).\n   - A **SentenceTransformer model** (`all-mpnet-base-v2`) is employed to preprocess and generate embeddings for the text data.\n\n## 2. **Vectorization and Embedding**\n   - Articles are tokenized and converted into high-dimensional vector representations using the SentenceTransformer model.\n   - These embeddings facilitate semantic similarity computations for downstream tasks.\n\n## 3. **Semantic Search with ChromaDB**\n   - A **ChromaDB client** is initialized to store and query vectorized data.\n   - Articles and their embeddings are stored in a collection named `news_collection`.\n   - A semantic search function allows querying the database with a given topic and retrieves the most relevant articles based on vector similarity.\n\n## 4. **LLM-Powered Summarization**\n   - A language model (LLM) is integrated using **Cohere** to generate concise summaries.\n   - A custom prompt template is defined, emphasizing accuracy, brevity, and adherence to the content.\n   - The summarization pipeline adheres to a one-shot learning approach by providing examples of input articles and expected summary outputs.\n\n## 5. **End-to-End Query and Summarization**\n   - Topics are used as input queries for semantic search.\n   - The retrieved articles are summarized using the LLM with the custom prompt.\n   - Human-written summaries from the dataset are included for comparison with the generated summaries.\n\n## 6. **Output and Evaluation**\n   - The pipeline produces three outputs for each topic:\n     - The full article retrieved through semantic search.\n     - The human-written summary from the dataset.\n     - The machine-generated summary from the LLM.\n   - Results are printed for each topic to allow for qualitative evaluation.\n\n## 7. **Key Features**\n   - **Semantic Search:** Powered by vector embeddings, enabling accurate retrieval of articles relevant to a query.\n   - **LLM Integration:** Leveraging Cohere to generate precise, human-like summaries.\n   - **Scalability:** Modular design for extending dataset size, embedding models, or summarization techniques.\n   - **Custom Prompting:** Carefully crafted prompts ensure alignment with the original content, minimizing hallucination.\n\n## 8. **Use Case Example**\n   Topics like:\n   - *Prince Harry's Tribute to Princess Diana on the 10th Anniversary of Her Passing.*\n   - *Zoe's Ark Accused of Child Trafficking in Chad Amid Adoption Controversy.*\n   are processed through semantic search and summarization, delivering concise and content-accurate summaries for user queries.\n\n\nThis pipeline provides a robust and modular foundation for applications in content summarization, semantic search, and natural language understanding.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install chromadb\n!pip install langchain\n!pip install

Radcliffe gains access to a \nreported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists \nthe money won't cast a spell on him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter \nand the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the \nworld, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink, \nand celebrity parties. \"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, \nsuddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an \nAustralian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. \nThe things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" \nAt 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror \nfilm \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. \nDetails of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no \ncomment on his plans. \"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \n\"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter \nfilms have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame \nand riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking \nto say 'kid star goes off the rails,'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to \ngo that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry \nPotter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will \nreprise the role in the last two films. Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest » . \nThere is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" \nabout author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \n\"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he \nmade his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer's \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced \nfor even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: \"I just think I'm going to be more \nsort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.

Here is his speech in full: . William and I can separate life into two parts. There were those years when we were blessed with the physical presence beside us of both our mother and father. Princes Harry and William greet guests at a thanksgiving service in memory of their mother. And then there are the 10 years since our mother's death. When she was alive, we completely took for granted her unrivaled love of life, laughter, fun and folly. She was our guardian, friend and protector. She never once allowed her unfaltering love for us to go unspoken or undemonstrated. She will always be remembered for her amazing public work. But behind the media glare, to us, just two loving children, she was quite simply the best mother in the world. We would say that, wouldn't we. But we miss her. She kissed us last thing at night. Her beaming smile greeted us from school. She laughed hysterically and uncontrollably when sharing something silly she might have said or done that day. She encouraged us when we were nervous or unsure. She -- like our father -- was determined to provide us with a stable and secure childhood. To lose a parent so suddenly at such a young age, as others have experienced, is indescribably shocking and sad. It was an event which changed our lives forever, as it must have done for everyone who lost someone that night. But what is far more important to us now, and into the future, is that we remember our mother as she would have wished to be remembered as she was: fun-loving, generous, down-to-earth, entirely genuine. We both think of her every day. We speak about her and laugh together at all the memories. Put simply, she made us, and so many other people, happy. May this be the way that she is remembered. Prince William's reading from St Paul's letter to the Ephesians: . I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name. I pray that, according to the riches of His glory, He may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through His Spirit, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, as you are being rooted and grounded in love. I pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. Now to Him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine, to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, for ever and ever. Amen. Thanks be to God. The Bishop of London's speech: . \"Who's cheating?\" The scene is an old people's home. Two residents are playing Beggar My Neighbor. Enter the Princess. The question from the royal visitor is unexpected but everyone laughs. Afterwards they comment on her large eyes and what life she brought into the room. One tiny incident, characteristic of countless other occasions in the Princess's public life in which she found the right word or the right gesture to bring cheer and comfort. Everyone here will have their own memories. I remember meeting Princess Diana for the very first time early in 1981 to discuss details of the wedding service in St Paul's. Even Archbishop's Chaplains have their share of proper diffidence and I was nervous entering the presence. It must have been a bewildering time for the Princess as well, but even then, at the age of 20, her capacity for empathy and her very strong intuitive power ensured that any tension soon evaporated. Prince Harry has spoken movingly and justly, as few others have the right to do, about the Princess as a mother. I want to dwell for a moment on her public work, its cost and its meaning. After her marriage, the Princess joined her natural gifts of beauty, empathy and powerful intuition with that extraordinary charge which association with the Royal Family generates. Led by our Queen and other members of the Royal Family, our constitution has developed in response to the challenges of the past century. There is a properly political sphere in which the monarch may counsel but doesn't intrude, but there is another sphere, vital to any sense of national unity and creativity, a sphere in which communities must be celebrated, common values articulated and the transcendent source of those values honored. We tend to be suspicious of public figures who wrap themselves in divinity and claim that their will is God's will, but if no-one can articulate in an un-ignorable way in the public realm the creative energy of the love that we see in Christ, the human face of God, then we shall find ourselves inhabiting a maimed and diminished society. And at a time when people are suspicious of rhetoric, the monarchy communicates by symbol and by simple speech, and the Princess brought her own gifts to this work. She was still only 26 in 1987 when she shook the hand of a patient at the opening of the Middlesex Hospital's Aids ward. It was the first in the UK and it is very hard now to credit the degree of fear and prejudice which surrounded Aids in the '80s. Those familiar with the field have no doubt that the Princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin. And she had a similar impact in the USA. An editorial in the New York Times in 1989 admitted ruefully that it had taken a foreign, and even a royal, dignitary to draw attention to a major public health concern in the US. Her work in the very last year of her life for the victims of landmines also caught the popular imagination internationally and certainly accelerated the adoption of the Ottawa Convention, banning the use of a weapon which disproportionately kills and maims women and children. She proved the eloquence of embrace and of touch which, of course, have been used by royal healers throughout the centuries. And as she said, in her words, \"the biggest disease today is not leprosy or TB but the feeling of being unwanted\". She sought out places of suffering, because they are so very often places of truth where the masks have been removed, and she was not afraid to be with the dying and to comfort them in an unsentimental way. Bill Deedes accompanied her on some of her visits. His response to the cynics was typically robust. He said: \"She was one who sought above all to help vulnerable people in society and who did it so well. She was good at this because she herself was vulnerable. She knew the feeling. She didn't set out to be a saint.\" The role brought great power but, like any member of the Royal Family, she also experienced the weight of expectation and the intensity of the scrutiny. Honoring but managing the role and not allowing it to take over one's personal humanity is a desperately difficult task. As we have heard from Prince Harry, his mother Diana did all that she could to prepare her sons for the work which lies ahead. She confessed to receiving a very great deal from some of those whose lives she touched. She said of John, a young Greek suffering from cystic fibrosis: \"He showed no sign of anger, no trace of bitterness but touched us all with an aura of optimism and hope for the future such that I have never before encountered.\" The love of Christ described in the lesson read by Prince William contains the essence of the spiritual life. Princess Diana recognized this quality of life in many of those, like John, whose lives she touched. It was a mystery which resonated deeply with her and for which she reached out. And the mystery is this - the more you go beyond yourself, the more you will become your true self; the more you lose yourself in loving and serving others, the more you will find yourself; the more you keep company with those who suffer, the more you will be healed. This is the knowledge which passes all understanding. This is certain and has been proved experimentally in the life of all the saints. It's easy to lose the real person in the image, to insist that all is darkness or all is light. Still, 10 years after her tragic death, there are regular reports of \"fury\" at this or that incident, and the Princess's memory is used for scoring points. Let it end here. Let this service mark the point at which we let her rest in peace and dwell on her memory with thanksgiving and compassion. Let us also, echoing the words of Prince Harry, look to the future and pray, in the words of St Paul, for all those who serve our country as members of the Royal Family and most especially for the sons who were so precious to her: . \"I pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power with all the saints to grasp what is the breadth and length and depth and height of the love of Christ and to know this love which surpasses knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of God.\" Amen.

Hundreds of women protest child trafficking and shout anti-French slogans Wednesday in Abeche, Chad. Six members of Zoe's Ark were arrested last week as they tried to put the children on a plane to France, where the charity said host families were waiting to take the children in. Three French journalists, a seven-member Spanish flight crew and one Belgian were also arrested. Representatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems with Zoe's Ark and thought they were on a humanitarian mission. Chadian President Idriss Deby hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be freed, his chief of staff, Mahamat Hissene, said Thursday. The president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of Abeche, where the children were taken, to a judge in N'Djamena, the capital, Hissene said. The transfer will take place Monday, according to media reports. The International Red Cross Committee, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and UNICEF said most of the children were living with their families before Zoe's Ark took them. The charity said the children were Sudanese orphans that it was trying to rescue from a war-torn nation. The agencies said most of the children also probably come from Chadian villages along Chad's border with Sudan. The children have been living in an orphanage in Abeche while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their identities.  Watch a report on whether the children are orphans » . Chadian authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and concealing their identities. Chad's interior minister said Zoe's Ark dressed the children in bandages and fake intravenous drips to make them look like refugees who needed medical help. The charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion and could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted. The Spaniards and Belgian are charged with complicity. The Spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released, a company executive said Thursday. \"We thought we were doing a humanitarian transport,\" said Antoni Cajal, sales director of Spain's Gir Jet charter firm. \"If an NGO [nongovernmental organization] has done something wrong, it's impossible for us to know.\" Spain's Foreign Ministry has publicly expressed its disagreement with the charges and has dispatched top diplomats to Chad to try to win the group's release. Over the weekend, the captain appealed urgently to be rescued, fearing the crew could be harmed or killed, Cajal said. But the four women and three men are in good condition in custody, Cajal said, based on his conversations with a Spanish consular official who came from Cameroon to Chad and has been able to visit them. The detention is the first problem of its kind for the company, which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue, Cajal said. On its Web site, Zoe's Ark describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in Paris that sends teams of physicians, nurses, firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in France, who then apply for asylum on their behalf. The Red Cross, UNHCR and UNICEF said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10, and they are healthy. The agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their backgrounds. \"So far, the interviews carried out with the children -- some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age -- led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from Chadian villages near the cities of Adre and Tine along the Chadian-Sudanese border,\" the agencies said. \"Ninety-one children said they had been living with their family, consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their parent,\" the agencies said, adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing. The agencies called their investigation painstaking and challenging because of the number of children, their youth and the situation in the region. Other French charities earlier had questioned whether Zoe's Ark could legally arrange adoption of children from Darfur, and contacted French authorities, according to French newspapers and The Associated Press. French authorities have reacted angrily to the Zoe's Ark trip, calling the group's actions \"illegal and irresponsible.\" The French Foreign Ministry has said the dispute will not affect France's participation in a European peacekeeping force due to be deployed along the border between Chad and Sudan. In response to the dispute in Chad, the Republic of Congo said late Wednesday it was suspending all international adoptions, The Associated Press reported. Reporters Without Borders said it will work for the release of the three journalists arrested in Chad. The organization said photographers Marc Garmirian of the Capa news agency and Jean-Daniel Guillou of the Synchro X agency were on assignment for their news organizations and were not part of the charity's efforts. The third journalist, Marie-Agnes Peleran of the TV station France 3 Miditerranee, was traveling with the group in a personal capacity, though she carried a camera from her station, Reporters Without Borders said.
